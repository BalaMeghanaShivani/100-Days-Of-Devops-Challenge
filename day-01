# Day 01 – Understanding Application Architecture & Linux Users

## 🔹 Objective
To understand the basic architecture of a real-world enterprise application and create a non-interactive system user on an application server as required by a backup agent.

---

## 🔹 Project Context (Nautilus Application)

Project Nautilus is a three-tier web application used by naval forces for operational and procurement decision support.

The application follows a standard enterprise architecture deployed in a data center.

### Architecture Overview
- **Client Tier**: Web browsers used by end users
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx, distributes HTTP traffic
- **Application Tier**: Multiple app servers running a LAMP stack
- **Data Tier**: MariaDB database server
- **Shared Services**: Storage, Backup, Mail servers
- **Jump Server**: Secure entry point for administrators

---

## 🔹 Key Architecture Concepts Learned

### 1. Three-Tier Architecture
- **Client Tier** sends HTTP requests
- **Application Tier** processes business logic
- **Data Tier** stores persistent data

This separation improves scalability, security, and reliability.

---

### 2. Role of App Servers
- App servers run application logic (PHP in LAMP stack)
- Multiple app servers exist for high availability
- Any app server should be able to handle any request
- App servers are stateless and interchangeable

---

### 3. Role of Load Balancer
- Receives all incoming HTTP requests
- Routes traffic to healthy app servers
- Does NOT care about Linux users or permissions
- Ensures fault tolerance and scalability

---

### 4. Jump Server Concept
- Acts as a secure gateway into the infrastructure
- Administrators access internal servers via jump server
- Improves security and auditing

---

## 🔹 Linux Users: Core Understanding

### System (Linux) Users vs Application Users
- **System users** exist at OS level (used for services, automation)
- **Application users** exist inside the web application
- These two concepts are completely separate

---

### Why Multiple Linux Users Exist
- Separation of responsibility
- Least privilege access
- Security and auditing
- Safer automation

Linux users do NOT have separate copies of data.  
They only have different **permissions** on the same system.

---

### Non-Interactive Users
- Used by services, agents, and automation
- Cannot log in via SSH
- Do not provide a terminal to humans
- Still able to run processes and own files

---

## 🔹 Task Performed

### Requirement
Create a user named `ravi` with a **non-interactive shell** on **App Server 1** to meet backup agent specifications.

---

### Command Used
```bash
sudo useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin ravi
